what do I want to build:

Make a small circle that I can move around

$$ Next Steps:
Generate projectiles towards the mouse pointer on click, from the circle
-make a projectile class
  -maybe do some general refactoring?
  -instantiate projectiles with a velocity vector, shoot them away from the player towards a click point
